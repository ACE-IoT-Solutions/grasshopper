# Agentic Sessions for Grasshopper

## Session: CI/CD Implementation (April 23, 2025)

### Summary
Created a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automating build, test, and release processes:

1. **Build and Test Pipeline**
   - Configured workflow to build Vue frontend and Python backend on every PR
   - Ensured proper integration between frontend build and Python package
   - Added automated testing for PRs to main and develop branches

2. **Automated Release Strategy**
   - Implemented automatic beta releases on merges to develop branch
   - Set up production releases on merges to main branch
   - Added versioning logic to handle different release types

### Files Created
- `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` - Main CI/CD workflow

### Features Implemented
- Vue.js frontend build with Node.js 23
- Proper artifact creation and packaging
- Dynamic versioning based on branch context
- Automatic GitHub release creation
- Prerelease flagging for beta versions
- Comprehensive release notes generation

### Future Work
- Add frontend testing to the CI pipeline
- Implement deployment automation for test environments
- Create Docker container build and publish steps
- Add code coverage reporting for frontend code

## Session: Test Implementation (April 23, 2025)

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive tests for the Grasshopper agent using two different testing strategies:

1. **Custom Mock Objects**
   - Created a framework of mock classes to simulate Volttron components
   - Implemented tests for agent configuration, BACnet functionality, and web server integration
   - Tests run without requiring an actual Volttron platform

2. **Volttron AgentMock Testing**
   - Used Volttron's built-in `AgentMock` utility for more integration-focused testing
   - Dynamically modified the agent's parent class to use mocked Volttron interfaces
   - Created tests that more closely align with standard Volttron testing patterns

### Files Created
- `tests/agent/conftest.py` - Test fixtures using custom mocks
- `tests/agent/test_agent_config.py` - Tests for agent initialization and configuration
- `tests/agent/test_agent_bacnet.py` - Tests for BACnet scanning functionality
- `tests/agent/test_agent_webserver.py` - Tests for web server setup
- `tests/agent/test_agent_with_volttron_mock.py` - Tests using Volttron's AgentMock
- `tests/TESTING.md` - Documentation of testing approaches
- `Grasshopper/requirements-test.txt` - Test dependencies

### Testing Topics Covered
- Agent initialization and configuration
- Config store methods for BBMD devices and subnets
- BACnet scanning functionality
- Web server and API integration
- Volttron platform integration

### Future Work
- Add more specific tests for BACnet device discovery
- Extend test coverage for RDF graph generation and processing
- Create tests for error cases and edge conditions
- Implement full integration tests with a running Volttron platform
